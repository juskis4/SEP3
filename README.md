# Online video games store (Semester Project)
The system that lets users buy games online

## Abstract
The aim of this project is to create an online game shop. The idea came due to the dangers for today’s society to shop in physical stores and physical limitations.
Technical details include developing a 3-tier architecture system. Also, includes the RESTful and sockets communication between tiers.
The project features full Blazor architecture, C#, and Java.
The results are that the system is complete with all requirements
implemented. However, there are some bugs, but the main system is working as intended. 

## Analysis
The main problem consists of the current danger of shopping in a physical game store
because of the pandemic, struggle to find the selected title and limited stock along with
waiting queues for purchasing a new game. The customer wants an online access
service with a wide variety of titles to choose from with no concern of not being able to
purchase a wanted new release. These main objects could be fulfilled by making an
online video game store. The decision was made to develop it, by having a 3-tier
distributed system that would have a broad assortment of video games to choose from
with the capability to purchase a game with minimal effort and receive it instantly after a
purchase has been made.
