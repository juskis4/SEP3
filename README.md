## Analysis
The main problem consists of the current danger of shopping in a physical game store
because of the pandemic, struggle to find the selected title and limited stock along with
waiting queues for purchasing a new game. The customer wants an online access
service with a wide variety of titles to choose from with no concern of not being able to
purchase a wanted new release. These main objects could be fulfilled by making an
online video game store. The decision was made to develop it, by having a 3-tier
distributed system that would have a broad assortment of video games to choose from
with the capability to purchase a game with minimal effort and receive it instantly after a
purchase has been made.
